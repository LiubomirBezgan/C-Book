ABSTRACT
THIS WORK AIMS TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBILITY OF FABRICATING CONDUCTIVE PATHS FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS FROM LOW-TEMPERATURE MELTING METAL ALLOYS ON LOW-TEMPERATURE 3D PRINTED SUBSTRATES AND MOUNTING THROUGH-HOLE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS USING THE FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING FOR METALS (FDMM) FOR STRUCTURAL ELECTRONICS APPLICATIONS. THE CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS ARE FLUX-CORED SOLDER WIRES SN60PB40 AND SN99AG0.3CU0.7. THE DEPOSITION WAS ACHIEVED WITH A SPECIALLY ADAPTED NOZZLE. A COMPARISON OF SOLDER WIRES WITH AND WITHOUT FLUX CORES IS DISCUSSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SOLDER ALLOYS EXHIBIT ADEQUATE WETTABILITY AND ADHESION TO THE POLYMER SUBSTRATE. THE SYMMETRICAL ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR CIRCUIT BASED ON BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS (BJT) WAS FABRICATED TO DEMONSTRATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF CONDUCTIVE TRACKS AND THROUGH-HOLE MOUNTINGS WITH THIS ADDITIVE TECHNIQUE. ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES FOR APPLYING THIS TECHNIQUE TO 3D-PRINTED STRUCTURAL ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
